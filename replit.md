# ADAPT by LMJ — Workspace

## Project Overview

Full-stack fitness coaching app. Athletes submit a daily check-in (sleep/energy/stress/soreness/motivation sliders) that generates an **ADAPT Score** (0-100), which determines their session mode (performance/normal/adapt/recovery) and adapts training loads accordingly. Coaches monitor athletes, manage training programs with 4 variant modes, handle alerts, and message athletes.

## Design System (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Background: `#0A0A0A` (dark electric)
- Neon green accent: `#00F5A0` (performance/normal)
- Cyan: `#00D9FF`
- Amber: `#FFB800` (ADAPT mode)
- Red: `#FF3B5C` (RECOVERY mode)
- Violet: `#7B61FF` (PERFORMANCE mode overlay)
- Fonts: Bebas Neue (titles) + DM Sans (body) + Space Mono (scores/numbers)

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9
- **API framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec — generates 795-line Zod + 3057-line React Query client)
- **Mobile**: Expo (React Native) — Task #2
- **Coach dashboard**: React + Vite — Task #3

## Key Implementation Notes

- Express 5 `req.params` returns `string | string[]` — always use `String(req.params["x"])` pattern
- JWT secrets throw loudly in production if `JWT_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` are not set
- ADAPT engine is server-side only — never recalculate on the client
- Check-in window closes at 14:00 UTC → 422 `CHECKIN_WINDOW_CLOSED`
- Pain in check-in → forces RECOVERY mode + P1 alert
- `POST /coach/clients/link` links an athlete by email to the coach's roster
- `POST /athlete/link` links an athlete to a coach by invite code
- `POST /sessions/:sessionId/feedback` allows an athlete to submit RPE + perceived difficulty for a completed session log
- `PUT /programs/:programId/sessions/:sessionId` verifies both program ownership (coach) AND session belongs to that program before updating (IDOR-safe)
- All UUID params are validated via regex before DB queries to avoid Postgres type errors
- Seed: 4-week program × 3 sessions/week = 12 sessions; each session × 4 variants; load progression +5%/week

## Backend (Task #1 — COMPLETE)

### API Server (`artifacts/api-server`)

Express 5 API with helmet, pino logging, rate-limiting (200 req/min general, 20/min auth).

**Routes mounted at `/api`:**
- `GET /api/healthz` — health check
- `POST /api/auth/register` — register coach or athlete
- `POST /api/auth/login` — login → returns accessToken + refreshToken
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` — refresh access token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — invalidate refresh token
- `GET /api/users/me` — get own profile
- `PATCH /api/users/me` — update profile
- `POST /api/checkins` — submit daily check-in (closes at 14:00 UTC → 422)
- `GET /api/checkins/today` — get today's check-in
- `GET /api/checkins/history` — check-in history (athlete)
- `GET /api/sessions/today` — get today's adapted session (requires check-in)
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/complete` — log completed session
- `GET /api/programs` — list athlete's programs
- `GET /api/programs/:id` — get program detail
- `POST /api/programs` — create program (coach only)
- `PATCH /api/programs/:id` — update program (coach only)
- `GET /api/coach/clients` — list coach's athletes with today's status
- `GET /api/coach/clients/:clientId` — single athlete detail
- `DELETE /api/coach/clients/:clientId` — remove athlete
- `GET /api/coach/clients/:clientId/checkins` — athlete check-in history
- `POST /api/coach/clients/:clientId/override` — override athlete mode
- `GET /api/coach/dashboard` — operational dashboard (todayAthletes, upcomingSessions 7d, pastSessions 7d, recentCompleted, activeAlerts)
- `GET /api/coach/calendar?year=YYYY&month=M` — all athletes' sessions for a given month (grouped by date)
- `GET /api/coach/alerts` — get all active alerts
- `PUT /api/coach/alerts/:alertId/resolve` — resolve alert
- `GET /api/coach/invite-code` — get coach's invite code
- `POST /api/coach/clients/link` — link athlete by invite code (coach flow)
- `POST /api/athlete/link` — link to coach by invite code (athlete flow)
- `GET /api/exercises` — list exercises
- `POST /api/exercises` — create exercise (coach only)
- `GET /api/messages` — list message threads
- `GET /api/messages/:userId` — get conversation
- `POST /api/messages` — send message
- `PUT /api/messages/:userId/read` — mark messages as read
- `GET /api/sessions/history` — session history (athlete, 30 days) including enriched fields: sessionName, durationMin, athleteNotes, exercises (exerciseId, exerciseName, loadKgUsed, setsCompleted)
- `GET /api/athlete/upcoming-sessions` — upcoming sessions for next 7 days from athlete's active program (UpcomingSession[])
- `GET /api/athlete/tests` — athlete's performance tests sorted by testedAt DESC (AthletePerformanceTest[])

**Services:**
- `adapt-engine.ts` — `calculateAdaptScore()` + `calculateAdaptedLoad()` (server-side only)
- `alert-job.ts` — daily cron at 09:00 checking for: inactivity (3 days), low scores (<25 for 2 days), high RPE (ALC-01), fatigue/soreness ≥4/5 for 2+ consecutive days (ALC-02)

### Database Schema (`lib/db`)

Tables: users, programs, sessions, session_variants, exercises, session_exercises, checkins, session_logs, exercise_logs, alerts, messages, notifications, personal_records, performance_tests

**performance_tests**: athlete_id (FK), coach_id (FK), test_type (varchar 50), exercise_id (nullable FK), exercise_name, value (decimal), unit, tested_at (date), notes, created_at

**Push schema:** `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push`

### ADAPT Engine Logic

- **Score**: sleep×0.25 + energy×0.20 + (1-stress)×0.15 + (1-soreness)×0.20 + motivation×0.20 → ×100
- **≥80** → PERFORMANCE (violet, +2.5% loads)
- **60-79** → NORMAL (green, baseline)
- **40-59** → ADAPT (amber, -22.5% loads, -20% volume)
- **<40** → RECOVERY (red, -50% loads/volume)
- Pain → forces RECOVERY + P1 alert immediately
- RPE modifier: yesterday RPE ≥9 → -5pts; <5 → +3pts
- Cycle phase modifier: luteal → -5pts

### Seed Script

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run seed
```

Two-step idempotent seed:
1. `seed.sql` — base data (coach + Owen + 97 exercises + Owen's programs)
2. `seed-patch.sql` — 6 demo athletes (Sara, Tom, Marie, Julien, Quentin×2) + their 4 programs + 52 sessions + 208 variants + 1248 session_exercises

Both files use `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` — safe to run multiple times.

Demo accounts (all password: `Demo1234!`):
- Coach: `coach@adapt.demo` (invite code: MARC01)
- Julien: `julien@adapt.demo` (scores 60-82, normal/performance)
- Sara: `sara@adapt.demo` (scores 80-100, performance)
- Tom: `tom@adapt.demo` — P1 pain alert (knee, RECOVERY forced)
- Marie: `marie@adapt.demo` — P2 inactivity alert (3 days no check-in)

## TypeScript & Composite Projects

Every package extends `tsconfig.base.json` with `composite: true`. Use `pnpm run typecheck` from root to build all project references. Always use `tsx` for running scripts in dev.

## Important Notes

- **Zod imports**: route files use `"zod"` (v3 via catalog); DB schema uses `"zod/v4"` 
- **UUID defaults**: `sql\`gen_random_uuid()\`` in schema (not `.defaultRandom()`)
- **JWT secrets**: `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` env vars (defaults to dev values if missing)
- **ADAPT Engine**: server-side ONLY, never recalculate on client
- **Check-in window**: closes at 14:00 UTC (returns 422 `CHECKIN_WINDOW_CLOSED`)
